Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm M.Sc. student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bologna. I'm deeply passionate about Deep Learning applied to CV, NLP and RLand all the maths that makes it work.
I've just completed a 6-months internship at Datalogic USA in California. I worked on deep metric learning for objects recognition that will be implemented in groecery store systems.

I mostly the following technologies for data manipulating and visualizing data and training models.
